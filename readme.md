# React

This incldues a React component which can be used within your project. You can pass in a onInit function which will be called with the instance of the typewriter so you can use the typewriter core API.

```jsx
import Typewriter from 'typewriter-effect';

<Typewriter
  onInit={(typewriter) => {
    typewriter.typeString('Hello World!')
      .callFunction(() => {
        console.log('String typed out!');
      })
      .pauseFor(2500)
      .deleteAll()
      .callFunction(() => {
        console.log('All strings were deleted');
      })
      .start();
  }}
/>
```

Alternatively you can also pass in options to use auto play and looping for example:

```jsx
import Typewriter from 'typewriter-effect';

<Typewriter
  options={{
    strings: ['Hello', 'World'],
    autoStart: true,
    loop: true,
  }}
/>
```
